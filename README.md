- [x] Split out meal cost (ie. cost of goods required) from full cost - could be
  easy, still not convinced this is necessary - Done, this makes a lot of sense

* Stores list - this is potentially quite complex - we would need to equate
  different lines that we judge to be the same product, not always a simple
  thing to do

* Can we just factor in a simple x% extra to a meal budget to hedge against the
  surprises you mention? This might be a lot simpler


*** Def things to do
- [x] Product ID needed in the output
- [x] Save / download picked ingredients list to pdf / some other format (eg.
  climate camp had up to 100 ingredients) - kinda done, there is a built in button!
- [x] You are correct in order quantity - haven't implemented that part yet :)

From chat with Tracey
- [x] Manually input prices (or allow for some pricing rates based on the item) -
  for things not in the GC price list
- [x] Replace "master scaling factor" with "num servings original" + "num servings output"
* Something about wanting onions and other vegetable quantities in grams as
  output? Maybe we can use a toggle here
- [x] Get price estimate of fraction of ingredients that will be used
